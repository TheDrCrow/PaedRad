# Welcome to Paediatric Radiology for Registrars

This is a resource to map the 2021 and 2016, L1 and L2 RCR Curricula onto the experiences and practice of Paediatric Radiology you will see during your training.     
It is not intended to replace reading a proper textbook, preferably more than once, but to try to understand the expectations and limits to the knowledge and skills required as a Radiology trainee in the UK, and more specifically along the Sussex coast.  

The usual proviso of this is not intended for a general audience and this is not medical advice, also applies.
